## Future Improvements
I used tools appropriate for the project's size; that's why I didn't use external libraries for local state management. For the same reason, I used React Router for navigation and not another tool like Next.js, for example.

   ### Technical Tasks
  - Implementation of i18n for proper content translation.
  - Linter and prettier to further improve code quality.
  - Decouple component logic to make them completely agnostic to business logic.
  - Organize TypeScript variables.
  - Tests

  ### UI
  CSS resets to ensure proper functionality in different browsers and operating systems.

  ### UX
  - Add a search bar to search for specific characters.
  - Accessibility improvements.
  
## Unresolved Detected Issues
Both problems do not prevent the compilation of the project, but I believe it's important to mention them. They were not resolved due to time constraints.

- ~~Local storage is not functioning correctly on some occasions.~~ The issue was bigger than I thought so I decided to fix it.
- In the console, there are two errors related to styled components.
